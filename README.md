# Adtoox Javascript Test

## Task

build a slideshow/carousel component using the provided resources to `startApp()`

- It should display all images provided.
- When all images have been displayed it should play the video. 
If any of the slideshow-items are clicked it should open a new tab/window with `resources.targetUrl`
- It should automatically switch between items

Feel free to do any styling(css) as you desire

## Restrictions

- You cannot use any external libraries or frameworks. 
- You should not edit or create any html elements via index.html with one exception: you can add stylesheets or additional javascript files if you want.

Altough, you a free to use any build-time/development tools such as typescript, babel, webpack, minify, karma, scss, less etc

## Focus on
Focus should be put on clean, modular and readable code. Modular, in this context, means that your classes(user-defined object types) and methods are easily reusable and no more abstract than they need to be to capture the essence of their function.

Good luck!
